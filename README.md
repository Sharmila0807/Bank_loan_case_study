# Bank_loan_case_study
Project Description:

Loan providing companies often face challenges when deciding to grant loans to individuals with insufficient or non-existent credit histories. Some individuals exploit this situation by defaulting on their loans. The provided dataset contains information about loan applications at the time of applying for a loan, and it includes two types of scenarios:

1. Clients with payment difficulties: These individuals had late payments more than X days on at least one of the first Y installments of the loan in the sample.

2. All other cases: This category includes all other cases where payments were made on time.

For this project, we will use the Numpy and Pandas libraries for data analysis and visualization.

Analysis Approach:

1. **Problem Statement**: The main problem is to assess and understand the factors that contribute to payment difficulties among loan applicants. We need to identify key insights, patterns, and correlations in the data to help loan companies make informed lending decisions.

2. **Missing Data Handling**: We will identify missing data and use appropriate methods to deal with them, such as removing columns with a high percentage of missing values or imputing missing values based on the nature of the data. We will clearly mention our approach in handling missing data.

3. **Outlier Detection**: We will identify potential outliers in the dataset and explain why we consider them as outliers. We won't necessarily remove outliers but will highlight their presence and potential impact.

4. **Data Imbalance Check**: We will determine if there is a data imbalance between clients with payment difficulties and all other cases. We'll calculate the ratio of data imbalance.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We will conduct univariate, segmented univariate, and bivariate analysis to explore the data. We'll summarize our findings in business terms to help the loan companies gain insights into customer behavior and risk factors.

6. **Correlation Analysis**: We will find the top 10 correlations for clients with payment difficulties and all other cases, taking into account the target variable. This analysis will be done by segmenting the data frame with respect to the target variable and identifying top correlations within each segment.

7. **Visualization and Presentation**: We will include visualizations to illustrate important insights and findings from the data analysis. The visualizations will be carefully chosen to explain numerical and categorical variables. The presentation will summarize the key results and provide explanations for why certain variables are important in differentiating clients with payment difficulties from all other cases.

Throughout the analysis, we will provide meaningful business interpretations and insights to help loan companies make informed decisions when evaluating loan applications.
